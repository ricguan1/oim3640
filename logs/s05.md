# Session 5 - Feb 3rd 

## what I set up today
today We went through some basic calculations and how to connect some of the materials we learnt from before together. By going through the calculations of tax on 2 different products, I now see how a program can run by itself. 

## work I learned from chapter 3
how to use functions to create short programs. also to be able to generate song lyrics by using repeat functions. 

## things that feel unclear
I am a little confused on how the tracebacks worked, especially with the range function. 

## Questions
1. all functions are local, and we have created them ourselves, so we can name it to anything?
