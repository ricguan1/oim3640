# Session 3 - Jan 27  

## what I set up today
today I downloaded the notebooks and added them to my repo

## work I learned from chapter 1 and 2
i learnt the fundamental structure of Python program, the differences between expressions and statements, how data types and variables work, and gained a basic understanding of how Python code works. 

## things that feel unclear
I am confused on how these expressions and statements function in more complex codes

## Questions
How do they work in larger programs, and how to ensure the code are still organized when it becomes more complex
