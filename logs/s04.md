# Session 4 - Jan 29  

## what I set up today
today in class we started using the chapters and going through the practices.

## work I learned from chapter 1 and 2
I had the chance to do some real practices by inputing my own numbers into the notebook chapters, it was also good to get a better understanding of how the functions and expressions worked. 

## things that feel unclear
I think I would need more practice to fully memorize the fundamentals and be able to understand it better. 
## Questions
I think this question would be answered as we progress further in this course, but how can we implement those codes into a program that can run and execute tasks.
