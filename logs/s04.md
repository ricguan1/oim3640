# Session 4 - Jan 29  

## what I set up today
today in class we started using the chapters and going through the practices for chapter 1 and 2

## work I learned from chapter 1 and 2
I had the chance to do some real practices by inputing my own numbers into the notebook chapters, it was also good to get a better understanding of how the functions and expressions worked. 

## things that feel unclear
I think I would need more practice to fully memorize the fundamentals and be able to understand it better. 
## Questions
1. are the spaces in between functions just for aesthetic purposes since I realized it is not necessary to run the code
2. ran into some issue with the print function, had it fixed with gpt, but still unclear on the explanation
3. if we are doing math functions, do we need to import math every single time
